            <p class="after_image">Python is a high-level indent based interpeted programming language. I personally use it for anything from building games with Pygame to writing data processing applications for local computers and manipulating API data from sources such as the hypixel API. Furthermore, I have written several network applications with python for a file transfer protocol and a messaging app. It is also my language of choice for computer vision applications with OpenCV2 and tensorflow.</p>

            <p class="after_image">C++ is a low-level extremely performant programming language that compiles directly to a binary. I have used C++ primarily with OpenGL for game development, but also to solve programming problems such as the advent of code when performance is critical. I have used C++ for a much faster file transfer protocol than was possible with python.</p>

            <p class="after_image">OpenGL is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. It works well in conjunction with C++, and I have used OpenGL to build a variety of game develelopment projects, including my current project Abyssal Zone.</p>

            <img src="rust.svg" class="tile_img">
            <p class="after_image">Rust is a high-level programming language with low-level performance, with a unique ownership system and lack of garbage collector that make it the most loved programming language according to stackoverflow several years running. I use Rust for anything that does not involve a GUI due to its many packages and speed. Examples of this include multi-client game servers, utility programs such as a search program, and algorithms such as a wordle solver.</p>
